/*
 This is our "Barrels" index (in this folder)
 Here we can just export all individual things

 We're also using TypeScript2's new "paths" to create non-directory import locations
 So instead of having to do something crazy like: "from '../../shared/'"

 We can just do:
 import { WebSocketService } from 'app-shared';

 Makes life easier!
